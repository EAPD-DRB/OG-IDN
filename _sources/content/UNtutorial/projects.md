## Final projects
This sections contains the final project descriptions and materials in {numref}`table-final-proj`. These projects were chosen from the broader set of projects listed in {numref}`table-broad-proj`.

```{list-table} UN OG-IDN Final Projects from 5-day Training
:header-rows: 1
:name: table-final-proj

* - Number
  - Project Description
  - Materials
* - 1
  - Impact of budgetary allocation on economic growth - education, health, income support spending programs, maybe including intergenerational impacts, employment/hours worked
  -
* - 2
  - Increasing the retirement age for public pensions + Changes to the contribution rate for public pensions (may pay particular attention to informal share who don’t contribute or benefit from public pension)
  -
* - 3
  - Changes in the CIT - perhaps with size thresholds (e.g., changing effective rate based on firm size, perhaps industry specific)
  -
* - 4
  - Infrastructure investment, nutritious meals program - growth effects + Is the funding plan of the sovereign wealth fund sustainable?
  -
* - 5
  - Debt financing, stabilize debt-gdp ratio with future taxes. What is the burden on future generations. Maybe just something with gov’t spending allocations (eg mix of transfers to infrastructure) more broadly
  -
* - 6
  - How does free education at university impact labor productivity, inequality – and fiscal cost of this (growth, distributional impacts)
  -
* - 7
  - Taxing fossil fuels/energy consumption

## Components of a good presentation

A good presentation can be powerfully effective at communicating information and influencing opinions. And a bad presentation can have equal and opposite negative effects, The following are some basic components of a good presentation.

**Components of a good presentation**

1. Background
    - Why should we care about this research?
    - What are the important characteristics of the policy or economic environment?
2. Research Question
    - Narrower (more specific) better than broad
    - Phrase your research question as a question: "How does increased education spending affect Indonesian GDP?"
3. Data/Model/Calibration Details
    - Did you do any specific calibration updates?
    - Was there any compelling data?
4. Results
    - Present model results: macro, fiscal, distributional, other
5. Conclusion
    - Summarize results
    - Acknowledge weaknesses and deficiencies
    - Future direction
