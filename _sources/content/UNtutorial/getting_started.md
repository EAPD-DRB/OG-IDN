## Install uv (which manages Python for you)
`OG-IDN` is a large-scale overlapping generations macroeconomic model of Indonesian fiscal policy. It is written in the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language, and the project's Python environments are managed with [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). You do not need to install a Python distribution yourself: `uv` downloads a compatible Python interpreter automatically and installs the exact package versions the model is tested against.

### Verifying you have already installed uv
Open your terminal (Mac or Linux) or command prompt/PowerShell (Windows) and type `uv --version`. This command should result in output like `uv 0.11.30`.
```{code}
>>> uv --version
uv 0.11.30
```

### Installing uv
Follow the [installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for your platform. On Mac or Linux:
```{code}
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```
On Windows, use the PowerShell command on the installation page. (If you already have any Python with `pip`, `pip install uv` also works on every platform.)

## Installing Git and GitHub

### Verifying you have already installed Git

#### On Mac or Windows
Open your terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows) and type `git --version`. You should get output like `git version 2.37.2`.
```{code}
>>> git --version
git version 2.37.2
```

#### On Linux
Open your terminal and type `git -version`. You should get output like `git version 2.37.2.
```{code}
>>> git -version
git version 2.37.2
```

### Installing Git
If you do not already have Git installed on your computer, we recommend that you follow the instructions on the GitHub page https://github.com/git-guides/install-git for installing Git. This page has downloadable executable installers that are easy to use.

You can feel free to download [Github Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop), which will install `git` as well as a GUI to interact with `git` and `GitHub`.  In this worksop, we'll give instructions for interacting with `git` from the command line. But you can use the GUI if you prefer. The GUI is a good way to learn how `git` works, and it is a good way to visualize the changes you are making to your code.


### Basic configuring of Git on your machine
Once you have Git installed, you will need to configure some of the basic settings in Git. To view all of your Git settings, you can type the following into your computers terminal:
```{code}
git config --list --show-origin
```
When getting set up, it’s important to enter your credentials so that `git` on your local machine is linked to your account on GitHub. You’ll do this by first entering your name:
```{code}
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```
Then, you’ll enter your email (using the email that you used to register your account on GitHub.com):
```{code}
git config --global user.email yourname@example.com
```
You can also set your default text editor for use with `git` by following the example below, which makes vim the default:
```{code}
git config --global core.editor vim
```

For more information on configuring `git`, see the full instructions from `git` [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).


### Set up a GitHub account
You will need a GitHub account to properly interact with OG-IDN. This will allow you to interact with the repository with a wide range of collaborative functionalities, including forking repositories, creating issues and discussions, and submitting pull requests. To set up a GitHub account, follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) at GitHub.com.

Most likely, the free organization account will be the right place to start for you. We recommend choosing a username suitable for a professional setting, as this will be your public profile on GitHub.

## Fork and clone OG-IDN repository
1. Forking the OG-IDN repository means that you are making a copy of that repository on your GitHub account in the cloud.
    - Go to the UN GitHub organization's main repository for OG-IDN (https://github.com/EAPD-DRB/OG-IDN).
    - In the upper-right area of the browser page, click the "Fork" button and select "Create fork". This will create an exact copy of the OG-IDN repository on your account. When you do this, you should see that the URL to the page has changed to `https://github.com/[YourGitHubHandle]/OG-IDN`.

2. The next step is to clone the repository from its current place in the cloud to your local computer's hard drive.
    - Open your terminal or command prompt
    - Navigate to the folder where you want this repository to reside. Make sure this is not a location on your hard drive that is mapped from the cloud. This file should live on your local computer. You already have the repository in the cloud on your GitHub account.
    - Copy the contents of your repository in the cloud to your hard drive by typing: `git clone https://github.com/[YourGitHubHandle]/OG-IDN.git`
    - Change directory to this new directory by typing: `cd OG-IDN`
    - Create an additional git remote named "upstream" that points to the main UN remote repository by typing: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/EAPD-DRB/OG-IDN.git`

## Create the OG-IDN environment with uv
`uv` creates a project [virtual environment](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/) — a local `.venv` folder inside the repository — so that users across operating system platforms and different hardware configurations run the code with the same packages, functionality, and results. The exact package versions are pinned in the repository's `uv.lock` file.

If you have installed `uv` and you have cloned your OG-IDN fork of the repository to your local machine, you can create the environment in a single step:
- Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the OG-IDN repository folder on your hard drive.
- Type the following command: `uv sync --extra dev`

This creates the `.venv` environment with the `ogidn` package and its development dependencies installed (downloading a compatible Python interpreter if needed). Now you will be able to run the modules of the OG-IDN model from scripts and from Jupyter notebooks: prefix any command with `uv run` (for example, `uv run python examples/run_og_idn.py`), or activate the environment first with `source .venv/bin/activate` (Mac/Linux) or `.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` (Windows PowerShell).

## Using Jupyter notebooks
A nice way to execute lines of code on your local computer is to use Jupyter notebooks. The `jupyter` package is installed as part of the development dependencies from the previous step. You can open a Jupyter notebook directly in VS Code, or you can open one from your terminal or command prompt.

### Open Jupyter notebook from terminal or command prompt
- If you are using Mac or Linux, open your terminal. If you are using Windows, open your command prompt.
- Navigate to the folder of the OG-IDN repository on your local machine.
- Open a Jupyter notebook session by typing `uv run jupyter notebook`. This will open a local server page that opens in your browser. This page will show the directory where you are currently working.
- Either click the "New" button in the upper-right portion of the screen, or select "File" then "New" then "Notebook" from the menu at the upper-right. Make sure to select the kernel from the repository's `.venv` environment.

Once you have completed these steps, you can interactively write code and execute it in steps using the Python code cells in the Jupyter notebook. You can also write text descriptions in the markdown cells.

## Choosing a text editor
Using a good text editor for your coding is a key productivity choice. We recommend the [VS Code (Visual Studio Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor from Microsoft (download from https://code.visualstudio.com/Download). This text editor is free, it is open source, and it has the largest community of active users and active developers. It also has a ton of extensions that help you customize and increase the efficiency of your coding workflow.
