    "1. Background\n",

    "2. Research Question\n",
    "    - Narrower (more specific) better than broad\n",
    "    - Phrase your research question as a question: \"How does increased education spending affect Indonesian GDP?\"\n",
    "3. Data/Model/Calibration Details\n",
    "    - Did you do any specific calibration updates?\n",
    "    - Was there any compelling data?\n",
